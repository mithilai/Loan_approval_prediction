# Loan Approval Prediction

This project is one of my early machine learning projects, focusing on predicting loan approval outcomes. Given certain applicant details, the model aims to predict whether a loan application is likely to be approved or not.

## Project Overview
The dataset used in this project, which is included in the repository, contains various features related to the applicant's profile, such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

### Model and Accuracy
For this project, I used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. After training and testing the model:
- **Test Accuracy**: 80%

The model's performance indicates a reasonable ability to generalize, although there is room for further tuning and experimentation.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Preparing data for machine learning
- Building and evaluating an SVM model
- Understanding the factors that influence loan approvals
